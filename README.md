# Unicode position conversion

This is a super simple no-deps conversion tool to convert between unicode codepoint offsets and JS string offsets.

This module exposes 3 methods:

#### uniCount(s: string) => number

Count the number of unicode codepoints inside a string. This is the equivalent of `string.length`, but this method returns a string's unicode length instead of its UCS2 length. (Who would ever want that?)

```javascript
const {uniCount} = require('unicount')

console.log('ðŸ’ƒ123'.length) // 5! Oh no!
console.log(uniCount('ðŸ’ƒ123')) // 4. Much better.
```


#### strPosToUni(s: string, strOffset?: number) => number

Convert from a JS string position to a unicode position.

For example, given the JS string `'ðŸ’ƒ123'`, JS string position 2 is right after the ðŸ’ƒ. Since that emoji is a single code point wide, the unicode equivalent of that position is 1.

```javascript
const {strPosToUni} = require('unicount')

console.log(strPosToUni('ðŸ’ƒ123', 2)) // 1
```

The offset is optional. If missing, this method has the same behaviour as `uniCount(str)`, for backwards compatibility.


#### uniToStrPos(s: string, uniOffset: number) => number

Convert a unicode codepoint position to a string offset position

This function does the inverse of `strPosToUni`. Given a string `s` and a number of codepoints `uniOffset`, this returns the string position right after specified number of unicode codepoints.

```javascript
const {uniToStrPos} = require('unicount')

uniToStrPos.uniToStrPos('ðŸ’ƒ123', 1) // 2
```
