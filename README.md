# Unicode position conversion

This is a super simple no-deps conversion tool to convert between unicode codepoint offsets and JS string offsets.

This module exposes 2 methods:

#### strPosToUni(s: string, strOffset?: number)

Convert from a JS string position to a unicode position.

For example, given the JS string `'ðŸ’ƒ123'`, JS string position 2 is right after the ðŸ’ƒ. Since that emoji is a single code point wide, the unicode equivalent of that position is 1.

```javascript
const {strPosToUni} = require('unicount')

console.log(strPosToUni('ðŸ’ƒ123', 2)) // 1
```

The offset is optional. If it is missing, it defaults to the length of the string (so bare `strPosToUni(str)` returns the number of unicode code points in the given string).


#### uniToStrPos(s: string, uniOffset: number)

Convert a unicode codepoint position to a string offset position

This function does the inverse of `strPosToUni`. Given a string `s` and a number of codepoints `uniOffset`, this returns the string position right after specified number of unicode codepoints.

```javascript
const {uniToStrPos} = require('unicount')

uniToStrPos.uniToStrPos('ðŸ’ƒ123', 1) // 2
```

Unlike `strPosToUni`, the second offset argument is not optional. Call `s.length` to discover the JS string length.
